Johannesburg Being a former governor of the Reserve Bank doesn't give you immunity to being conned at an ATM Tito Mboweni has learnt.On Thursday, he was duped out of R5 000, and took to Twitter to complain. Mboweni said: Be alert at the ATMs at Shell and Caltex petrol stations, N1, Midrand. Just been duped and lost my card and 10 minutes later, R5k withdrawn. He tweeted a second time: There is an ATM thug operating there. He looks like a perfect gentleman, bold head (sic), smartly dressed and seemingly very helpful. Be warned! In a cheeky response, a Gwede Mantashe parody account tweeted: Well @tito_mboweni THIS is becoming a habit! At least we know it wasn t the first time you were duped. (Johann) Rupert has been doing it for years. Others were more sympathetic. eNCA news reporter Zikhona Tshona tweeted: Don t use any garage ATM, especially during this time. Sorry for your experience.
