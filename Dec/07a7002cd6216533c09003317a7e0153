Johannesburg - Preparing for her final matric exams wasn t easy for Karin Lee.The teenager had to cut back on sleep and watching TV, but she couldn t get out of doing her share of the household chores.Then tragedy struck when she was about to start writing, when her grandmother in Taiwan died. The fact that she could not attend the burial - as she had exams to write - intensified her pain.However, she did so well through it all that she achieved 10 distinctions in her exams, becoming the top pupil at Holy Rosary School for Girls in the east of Joburg.Check out our special Matric Results page hereKarin said: I think part of my encouragement to work hard is that I like doing well, and my family are also people who used to do well in their academics. The shy and petite Karin s entire academic year was strong, with her school presenting her with numerous awards. These included those for the highest mark and distinctions in Life Sciences, English, Advanced Programme English, Afrikaans, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Visual Art. She was also re-awarded her academic full colours. Despite having been a top achiever throughout her school career, her grandmother s death affected her so much that she doubted that she would do well in her exams. We were very close, it was very difficult for me, she said.Karin plans to study actuarial science or medicine at the University of Stellenbosch.School principal Belinda Damhuis said she was proud of Karin and the other girls from the school as they had all worked hard. The one thing we re noticing with many of our students is that they spend a lot of time on their studies. And even with her exceptional academic achievements, Karin has remained humble - this is an admirable trait. The Star
