Johannesburg Four heavily armed men allegedly robbed an ATM at the Caltex filling station garage in Doornfontein, Johannesburg around 4am on Wednesday morning, making off with an undisclosed amount of money. Speaking to The Star on Wednesday morning, Captain Richard Munyai of the Jeppestown Police said one suspect carried an AK-47, while the other three were armed with 9mm pistols. He said the robbers held staff hostage while proceeding to detonate the ATM with dynamites. They also made off with the garage s safe, he said. Video footage is available showing one suspect standing guard outside the garage shop with an AK-47. Unfortunately, the suspects were wearing balaclavas and (leather) gloves which could be difficult when identifying them. We will definitely try our best during our investigation to identify them, and this video footage will be important in our investigation, Munyai said, adding that a case of armed robbery has been opened. Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko reported earlier this year when he released the crime statistics that there had been a 15.1 percent increase in both ATM bombings and cash-in-transit heist from the previous reporting year, with Joburg being flagged as a hot spot for these crimes. No injuries were reported at the Caltex bombing and arrests were yet to be made, Munyai said. [email&#160;protected] The Star
