Johannesburg - In rare circumstances, the City of Ekurhuleni has identical twins serving in its community safety department. William Ntladi, spokesman for the city s emergency services, said both brothers started as firefighters before decided to transfer to the metro police department. Previously, it was difficult to work out who was who between the two especially when they were wearing the same uniform on duty. Members of the public are still puzzled by the brothers especially when they both are at the same incidents in their respective lines of duty. Meshack Mandla Sambo is with the Ekurhuleni metro police department s bike unit as a supervisor while Shadrack is a shift manager at Edenvale fire station.&nbsp; Both are still still studying at the Tshwane University of Technology in their respective fields of duties.
