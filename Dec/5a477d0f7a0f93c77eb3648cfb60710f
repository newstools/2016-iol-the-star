Johannesburg - A stray zebra was found wandering in the area near Rand Airport in Germiston.The animal had sustained minor bruising to her chest and legs from continued running through bush and fences. She has been treated for her injuries.The Wildlife Protection Unit of the National Council of the SPCA said they were called to assist the zebra, which was reported to be roaming in the Germiston area on Tuesday.The animal welfare organisation said it was unknown where the animal came from.The NSPCA said in a statement: A representative from the SPCA in Germiston was initially dispatched to investigate, and the zebra was located grazing on a golf course. A close eye was kept on the animal as arrangements were made to take her to a place of safety. The organisation said Gauteng Nature Conservation was alerted and had undertaken to go out and look for the animal. The first step taken by the NSPCA was to obtain the use of a specialised game trailer. Appreciation is expressed to the Johannesburg Zoo for the loan and use of the trailer. The services of a specialised wildlife veterinarian were obtained, and personnel went to the scene. The zebra mare was tranquillised and transported to a wildlife conservancy in the south of Joburg. To enable monitoring by the veterinarian, the mare was confined in a boma for the first two days. And we are delighted to announce that she is progressing well and has been released to join an existing herd of zebra currently on the conservancy. &nbsp;A huge thanks to @SpcaGermiston and all the caring individuals who helped in the rescue of the #zebra https://t.co/QjPcmh3oam pic.twitter.com/eThcTPhLld&nbsp;The NSPCA said it would continue to monitor the animal s progress and ensure that the rest of her life would be in a non-captive situation with others of her species.The Star
