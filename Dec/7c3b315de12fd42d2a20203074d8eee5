Johannesburg - A survivor of the deadly Windmill Park, Boksburg, taxi-rank shooting two years ago is deeply distressed that the high court sitting in Palm Ridge acquitted the two accused in the case - and feels justice was not served.Mthobisi Mncube and Saseko Ndlovu were acquitted of four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for the November 2014 violence, which claimed the lives of four people.Each of the victims was shot multiple times, dying at the scene. A fifth person, a woman, was killed when a minibus taxi fleeing the hail of bullets knocked her down in a hit-and-run accident.The gunmen were apparently shooting indiscriminately, and the taxi driver, dodging the hail of bullets, struck the woman and failed to stop.The two suspected gunmen appeared in court on Friday, where they were both acquitted on all charges. Upon hearing this, the survivor approached The Star. Preferring to remain anonymous, he said he was shot in the back, with the bullet entering his right shoulder blade and exiting his chest. He remembers that day vividly, saying: The person who shot me came to ask where my gun was. He thought I had a gun on me. I told him I did not have a gun. But he continued shooting and asking other people whether they had a gun on them. I saw people dying on the spot. I was the only survivor. As a result of the injury, the man has difficulty moving the right side of his body and sometimes suffers blurry vision in his right eye. But despite his sight and mobility problems, he says he is more saddened for the families of the five people who lost their lives. At least I m still alive. What about the families who won t get justice for their loved ones? I feel that the justice system has failed them more than me, he said.Ndlovu was released immediately after the ruling, but Mncube remains in custody as he has other cases pending for alleged gun violence.Family representatives of Mncube and Ndlovu refused to comment. @khayakoko88The Star
