It was in February 2015 that Lungile s mother Lindiwe* first laid a charge of rape on her daughter s behalf at Dawn Park police station in Boksburg.Their next-door neighbour had allegedly abducted and raped Lungile on two separate occasions, but she was too afraid to report the incident as he had threatened to kill her family if she told anyone about the abuse. It was only after the second rape that she finally revealed to her mother what had happened and after a medical examination confirmed that penetration had occurred. While police arrested the neighbour, he was quickly released on bail. But months later, a letter came out of the blue from the SAPS saying that the case would not be pursued, with only one reason mentioned: No DNA result. Despite her own attempts, Lindiwe was unable to hear any further information from the police or NPA about why they would not pursue the case, even though her daughter would be able to testify against her alleged abuser. Only after Lindiwe s employer became involved, sending the NPA a formal legal letter through an advocate, that they responded and said they would reconsider opening the case. Even though the family received a response in October this year saying the complaint had been noted by the NPA, they have heard nothing since. Meanwhile, the neighbour has since fled from his home, and his location is seemingly unknown. This is not right at all. My daughter is still traumatised. The police won t help me. I have heard nothing from the NPA, Lindiwe told The Star, barely able to contain her tears. While queries about the matter were sent to the NPA, no response was given by the time of publication. *Not their real namesThe Star
