Johannesburg - Big Concerts has assured Beliebers that they will be safe while attending the Justin Bieber concert next year.This comes after millions of rand in cash was stolen after the international superstar performed at the FNB Stadium in Joburg in 2013.Officials at the time of the Joburg Bieber concert believed that the robbery might have been an inside job as the thieves entered a strong room where the money was stored. It must be somebody who knows the premises, who knows the layout of the building. It looked like they had been working on this area for a considerable amount of time, Stadium Management South Africa chief executive Jacques Grobbelaar said at the time.It was believed that the thugs made their entry from a hole in the ceiling by rope, all while hundreds of security guards patrolled the premises.But Big Concerts publicist Dionne Domyan-Mudie yesterday told Independent Media that the Bieber concert, which is set to take place in May next year, would be fully secured. We have the best security in the world, Domyan-Mudie insisted.She added that Big Concerts had hosted other big concerts, including One Direction and Bruce Springsteen, and that they had many security personnel, which would also be the case for the Bieber concert. We will have security on the perimeter of the stadium, inside, outside, on the stage as well as backstage. Concert-goers can be assured that they will be safe. Meanwhile, Domyan-Mudie said that the investigation into the theft of money during the previous Bieber concert was still ongoing.Yesterday, the global superstar announced that his Purpose World Tour would be coming to South Africa next year. Tickets go on sale on December 15 at 9am with prices ranging from R350 to R1 540.
