Johannesburg - Police are confident that the arrest of two men in Westbury on Sunday may solve several cases involving gang-related shooting incidents in the area.According to Gauteng police spokesperson Lieutenant Lungelo Dlamini, the arrests follow a random shooting in which five people were shot and wounded on Sunday. Two victims were shot in the upper body and are in a serious but stable condition. Three were wounded in the lower body. All five were taken to the Helen Joseph Memorial Hospital and are recovering there, Dlamini said.The shooting incident happened around midday on Sunday where the two men travelling in red VW Golf allegedly fired shots from their moving vehicle and wounded five other men. Follow-up investigations led to the arrest of two suspects later in the day, he said.Sunday's shooting follows another incident on Friday night in which a man was shot dead in Westbury while he was standing next to his vehicle. The suspect or suspects drove away from the scene in a silver VW vehicle. A murder case is being investigated. The motive for the shooting is still unknown, Dlamini said. With regards to yesterday's (Sunday's) case, five attempted murder cases are being investigated, he added.In August, hundreds of Westbury residents took to the streets in protest against the continuous shootings believed to be drug and gang-violence related.
