Johannesburg - Former Joburg ANC Youth League leader Patrick Wisani appeared cocky as his murder trial finally got under way on Friday.Wisani is accused of beating his girlfriend Nosipho Mandleleni to death with a sjambok and broomstick in September last year.He responded in a self-assured manner each time Judge Mohamed Ismail addressed him in the high court sitting in Randburg.When the proceedings drew to a close, Judge Ismail ordered that Wisani be kept in the court&#x2019;s holding cells until his new advocate, Lindumzi Ndongeni, had finished his consultation.Wisani interjected, complaining about the food he received while in custody.&#x201C;The problem is they give you five slices of bread the whole day. My family are here, they want to give me food,&#x201D; he said.Judge Ismail said it was not within his control what food Wisani had access to while in custody.The matter has been subjected to numerous delays; first, when the original trial came to an abrupt halt after Judge Andr&#xE9; Louw recused himself in August, and then to allow Wisani time to finalise his defence team.On Tuesday, Judge Ismail had ordered Wisani&#x2019;s attorney, Mpho Selepe, to ensure that he had arranged an advocate who would be ready to proceed on Friday.On Friday, Ndongeni told the court that he had received instructions from Selepe only the previous day.But Selepe was not present in court once again, despite apparently telling Ndongeni he was on his way.A livid Judge Ismail said: &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t wait for Mr Selepe to come to court as and when he feels fit to come to court. It&#x2019;s almost 11.30 and he&#x2019;s still not here. I&#x2019;m beginning to get the impression that he&#x2019;s not focused on this matter.&#x201C;All I want to know from you is, is Mr Wisani prepared to proceed with you as his advocate? I&#x2019;m not going to wait for Mr Selepe, because he might come, he might not come.&#x201D;As the trial commenced, Wisani pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder as well as charges of the intimidation and assault of two State witnesses.Siphokazi Mandleleni, the twin sister of Nosipho, was expected to testify on Monday.
