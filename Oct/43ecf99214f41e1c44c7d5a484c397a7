By Anna CoxBart Zaayman, who worked for the old SA Railways and Harbours for 42 years, is passionate about the old postal tunnels.After joining as a junior draftsman, he moved up the ranks to a confederation management specialist, looking after the information management processes to facilitate and maintain Transnet infrastructure.It was there that he discovered the architectural plans of the tunnels while he was scanning documents on to a digital platform for a developer who wanted to construct an inter-mobile transport facility in Loveday Street close to the SA Railways head office in Rissik Street in central Joburg.&quot;While on a site walkabout, we noticed there were large vents on the property and we realised we were sitting on top of an underground mail room where post from the Jeppe and Rissik streets station was sent for sorting. From the mailing room, the post was sent, also in underground tunnels, to the different platforms at Park Station,&quot; he said.The area has now been turned into a parking lot, but the air vents still exist.The Star met Zaayman at the Transnet Heritage Library where he proudly showed the plans and old photos of the tunnels. He has walked through the tunnels.He said he was surprised at the excitement over them.&quot;We, as the older Transnet employees, and our families, all knew about them, but I suppose anyone younger than 50 would not know,&quot; he said.There was such huge potential in the tunnels, he added. A few years ago, he proposed that old miniature railway carts which were used to train railway staff on signalling and other rail matters at the Esselen Park training facility in Kempton Park - and which are lying there rotting, complete with the railway lines - be placed in the Rissik Street tunnel to ferry people up and down as a tourist attraction.&quot;People were interested at the time, but I retired and the whole thing was put on hold. It is a great pity because the tunnels, the carts and the railways lines, which are part of the city's heritage, could have been put to good use,&quot; he said.The tunnels are knee-deep in water, but Zaayman said there were pumps which were used in the old days that could be repaired.He has walked through the tunnels several times, as well as through the old Rotunda coach terminal building where people would catch buses to the airport, and the Concourse, a huge hall where people would book their tickets and then go and dine in the upmarket Blue Room restaurant.The Concourse, designed by a Sir Herbert Baker protege, Gordon Leith, was richly decorated with a Pierneef painting and hand-painted Leith tiles which portrayed scenes of South Africa. The decor reflected the era of opulence and 1930s decadence.Both are now closed, and this was also a pity, he said, because there was a lot of heritage in both buildings.&nbsp;Tribute to esteemed city engineerWilliam Pryce-Rosser was the engineer who designed Joburg's underground tunnels.The Star tracked down Anne Benson, his granddaughter, who now lives in the Western Cape.A street in the suburb of Prolecon, south of Joburg, has been named after him because he was involved in many of the city's road-building projects.Benson says she has always known about the tunnels because her grandfather kept meticulous notes and photos of the progress of the construction, which she now has.Pryce-Rosser was born in Wales. He studied engineering at London University and worked on the mines in Wales for some time before moving to Joburg.He was district engineer for the former Johannesburg City Council and helped design, among many others, the Orlando Power Station as well as Harrow Road and its bridge, which was renamed Joe Slovo Drive in the new dispensation.He was particularly proud of this one, said Benson.Pryce-Rosser lived in Parkview for most of his life, and Benson would often stay with her grandparents. 'He was a very formal, stern, almost Victorian man, mostly always dressed in a suit,&quot; she said.&quot;He would casually talk about the tunnels, but I don't remember listening properly,&quot; she said.Pryce-Rosser died in 1983, but Benson remembers him fondly.She supplied The Star with her favourite tunnel photos, hoping a tribute would be paid to him. @annacox [email&#160;protected]The Star
