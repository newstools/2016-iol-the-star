Johannesburg - The mother of the young woman allegedly murdered by Patrick Wisani is still so traumatised by her child&#x2019;s brutal death that she can&#x2019;t sleep at night.Noxolo Mandleleni spoke to The Star on Thursday at the high court sitting in Randburg, where Wisani&#x2019;s trial is under way.Mandleleni&#x2019;s daughter Nosipho was beaten to death with a sjambok and a broomstick at a Yeoville house in September last year.After going through a string of lawyers, Wisani elected to defend himself during the trial.Noxolo said the arrogance of her deceased daughter&#x2019;s lover haunted her.&#x201C;What makes me angry is that he has this pride. He doesn&#x2019;t act like someone who has done something wrong. He doesn&#x2019;t feel ashamed,&#x201D; said the distraught woman. &#x201C;Those things make me so angry. I can&#x2019;t sleep at night when I come (back) from court.&#x201D;Noxolo left her home at the village of Whittlesea in the Eastern Cape to attend the trial. &#x201C;I will come here every day until it&#x2019;s done. It&#x2019;s very difficult but I just force myself (because) I want to know the truth. I&#x2019;ll always have that picture of my child in my head.&#x201D;On Thursday, three police officers gave more details on evidence collected at the crime scene. During the testimony of police photographer Constable Sibusiso Shongwe, it emerged that some of the key evidence at the crime scene had been hidden away, presumably by the murderer.Prosecutor Faghre Mohamed asked: &#x201C;Was the sjambok visible to anybody who entered the room?&#x201D;Shongwe responded: &#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t have seen it because for me to see it, I had to climb on to a chair and it was hidden up inside the wardrobe.&#x201D; He said a bloodied vest and jersey had also been hidden out of sight at the back of the wardrobe.On Wednesday, Wisani accused police officer Captain Nomonde Qilingana of tampering with evidence at the crime scene.The trial was set to continue on Friday, with two more police officers and a technical expert from a cellphone service provider expected to testify.
