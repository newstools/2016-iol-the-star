Johannesburg - The baby boy who was abducted during an apparent house robbery in Soweto had not been found by Thursday night.The police said their investigations were continuing.&#x201C;We are still busy with the investigation and we are constantly in touch with the family, providing any help they need from the police regarding this matter,&#x201D; police spokesperson Captain Mpande Khoza said on Thursday.The 14-month-old boy, Siya Mlambo, was abducted on Tuesday after his mother, Mandisa, was followed home by two men who forced their way into her Protea Glen home and demanded money from her and the baby&#x2019;s nanny.The men then took the mother&#x2019;s bank card, forced the nanny into the mother&#x2019;s car and drove to an ATM to withdraw money.When they returned to the house, they abducted the baby and took cellphones, clothes and other items. They tied up the mother and nanny before fleeing the house.Mandisa&#x2019;s account of her nightmare had led police officers to suspect that her lover&#x2019;s ex-girlfriend was behind the abduction. She had explained to the officers that one of the men had told her that her relationship with her partner Thabo, who is Siya&#x2019;s biological father, &#x201C;had made my sister suicidal, and for that I should pay&#x201D;.&#x201C;He told me that my baby or I should die for this,&#x201D; Mandisa said, adding that she had pleaded with the man to spare her baby&#x2019;s life and take hers instead, to no avail.On Thursday, Gauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza dispatched a team of social workers to assist the traumatised family.&#x201C;Our hearts are with the Mlambo family. I have asked social workers to give them trauma counselling.&#x201D;Call Colonel Van Wyk on 082 308 7487 with any information. [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
