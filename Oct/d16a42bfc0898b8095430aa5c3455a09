Johannesburg - Chaotic scenes erupted at Wits on Monday with students hurling stones at private security guards and police retaliating by firing rubber bullets and tear gas.Students stormed the Braamfontein campus, disrupting lessons as the university tried to resume the academic programme following last week's disruptions.Prior to the altercation, masses assembled outside Solomon Mahlangu House and peacefully danced and sang struggle songs.But things took a turn for the worse when students tried to enter Solomon Mahlangu House.A group threw rocks at security guards as they prohibited them from gaining entry into the building. Police then retaliated, firing several rounds of rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the protesters.It is not yet clear if anyone sustained injuries during the stand off.&nbsp;University management took the decision at the weekend that classes there would resume on Monday after an attempt to open its doors failed last week when violence erupted between the police and protesting students.Several of them sustained injuries at the time when rocks were hurled and several rounds of rubber bullets and stun grenades were fired.The university said as the classes continue, students could continue their protests but only at designated areas.They added that students who were caught carrying any weapons would be suspended.Despite this, many of the protesters carried sticks as they marched.A large police contingent were stationed around the university from the morning to monitor proceedings.Violent student protests erupted since last month when government announced a 2017 fee increase.Students have since insisted that they would continue their plight until their demand for free tertiary education was met.&nbsp; #Fees2017 #FeesMustFall Students have regrouped at the Great Hall after marching around campus @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/jvcIkx0n1n#Fees2017 #FeesMustFall Students have regrouped at the Great Hall after marching around campus @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/jvcIkx0n1n Lindi masinga (@IamSwazi) October 10, 2016</blockquote> &nbsp;The Star
