Johannesburg - New finance MMC Professor Rabelani Dagada, who describes himself as a &#x201C;reluctant politician&#x201D;, got his first pair of shoes when he was in Grade 8.Dagada, now in control of the City of Joburg&#x2019;s R55 billion budget, was born in Alexandra, but was sent to Venda to attend school, due to political upheaval in the area.&#x201C;I would walk 6km to school and back, barefoot, in the summer and winter, in all weather conditions - there were no shoes and no umbrellas.In Grade 8, my uncle, who was a policeman, gave me his shoes. &#x201C;We had classes under trees but this taught me resilience and how to work hard. I have developed a thick skin,&#x201D; he said.He had only two pairs of trousers to his name when he started studying at the University of Johannesburg.Among his many accomplishments are author, associate professor, development economist and a policy fellow at the SA Institute of Race Relations. His academic career involves four institutions: Wits Business School, University of Johannesburg, Unisa and the Vaal University of Technology.He &#x201C;thinks he has about five degrees&#x201D; and many diplomas - too many to remember.Dagada lives in Midrand with his wife and four children.&#x201C;When I see children running around Alexandra, I see myself before I left. I tell them this was me in my youth. I had no shoes and slept on the floor of a shack most of my childhood - but there is hope for them.&#x201D;He became involved in DA politics in 2011 when he saw Mmusi Maimane on TV one day.&#x201C;He was my former student at university, so I called him. I had joined Cope but the party was breaking up and Mmusi convinced me to join the DA.&#x201C;I have risen through the ranks in the party and have found my political home there,&#x201D; he said.His family were initially shocked at his joining the DA, but soon accepted his decision.&#x201C;I have actually taken a loss in salary by accepting this position, as I was offered the position of deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Venda. But, as clich&#xE9;d as this may sound, I am really hoping to make a positive impact on the people of the city.&#x201C;I want to make a real impact on poverty. I want to also make an impact on eliminating corruption, which is rampant in the ANC.&#x201D;He said that after his five-year term of office, he would return to the love of his life - teaching.
