Parliament - National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams is expected to address the media about the fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Monday.A media briefing called by the NPA is due to start at 10.30am.Gordhan is set to appear in court on Wednesday over charges against him by the National Prosecuting Authority.&nbsp;On Sunday both Gordhan s lawyers and the NPA denied reports that they were in talks on the dropping of the charges against Gordhan.It followed two massive blows to the NPA s case last week, when a Sars senior lawyer was allegedly held hostage by the Hawks, who were demanding documents on the decision to charge Gordhan.An email on the decision to charge Gordhan was mistakenly sent to Sars s deputy director for law administration, Vlok Symington.Symington has lodged a complaint with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.The director of the Helen Suzman Foundation, Francis Antonie, filed supplementary affidavits in the high court in Pretoria last week that there were more than 3 000 civil servants who had received early retirement between 2005 and 2010.This flew in the face of the NPA decision to charge Gordhan for approving the early retirement of former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.On Sunday, Gordhan s lawyer Tebogo Malatji denied that there were discussions between them and the NPA on the dropping of the charges against the finance minister. There have been no discussions. We are waiting to hear what is going to be the next move, he said.Malatji said they did not make representations to NPA head Shaun Abrahams. This was after Abrahams was asked by MPs if he would consider reviewing the charges against Gordhan.He told Parliament recently he was open to the idea of Gordhan, former Sars boss Oupa Magashula and Pillay making representations.Both Magashula and Pillay made representations, but Gordhan refused on the basis that Abrahams had spurned their efforts several times.NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said on Sunday there were no talks between them and Gordhan. There are no discussions whatsoever, the NDPP (national director of public prosecutions) exercises his discretion independently, he said. The NDPP is still considering the matter, no decision has been taken in respect of the representations made by Mr Pillay and Mr Magashula, said Mfaku.Political Bureau
