Johannesburg - Murder accused Patrick Wisani has accused a senior police officer of lying and tampering with the crime scene.Wisani, who is defending himself, allegedly beat his girlfriend Nosipho Mandleleni to death with a broomstick and a sjambok last year.He was the ANC Youth League chairman for the Joburg inner city branch at the time.On Wednesday, while cross-examining Yeoville cop Captain Nomonde Qilingana, Wisani disputed her version of events.Qilingana told the high court sitting in Randburg that Wisani fled the crime scene after Nosipho&#x2019;s sister, Siphokazi, accused him of murdering her twin.&#x201C;While I was trying to listen to Patrick and to the lady who was screaming, Patrick ran through the corridor. I tried to call him, but he vanished.&#x201D;But Wisani said Qilingana asked him to leave so she could talk to the distraught Siphokazi in private. She denied this.Wisani pointed to differences between Qilingana&#x2019;s statement and police photos of the scene. He said pieces of evidence such as blood-spattered takkies and a sjambok were photographed in different locations to those in Qilingana&#x2019;s statement.He asked her why she had turned Nosipho&#x2019;s body over for the photographer to photograph. &#x201C;You tampered with the crime scene,&#x201D; he said.Qilingana responded: &#x201C;I am a detective. I was doing my duty. I&#x2019;ve been in the SAPS for 21 years and working as a detective for 12. I know my job.&#x201D;Gory details of Nosipho&apos;s injuries emerged as Wisani read through Qilingana&#x2019;s statement.&#x201C;The deceased was brutally assaulted all over; she was even bleeding from her vagina. I noticed bruises, marks all over her body, like a person who was beaten with wire,&#x201D; it stated.&#x201C;There were bloodstains on the wall. I searched the room and found the sjambok with a bloodstain.&#x201D;Wisani&#x2019;s cross-examination dragged on as he repeated the same questions until Judge Mohamed Ismail intervened.The trial was expected to continue on Thursday.
