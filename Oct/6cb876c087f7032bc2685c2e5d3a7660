Johannesburg - An Alexandra family have been accused of hospitalising their teenage relative after attacking her physically and setting their dog on her - all because of a property dispute. Meanwhile, an NGO monitoring the court proceedings linked to the crime has discovered this isn t the first time the family have been at the centre of violent allegations against 16-year-old Mbali* and her mother. On Wednesday, Mbali s paternal aunts, cousin and half-sister appeared in the Alexandra Magistrate s Court over an incident in August that saw Mbali hospitalised. According to Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA), on August 8, the group of relatives allegedly attacked Mbali, even using their dog to continue their assault. While her mother was able to save the teenager and transport her to hospital, she sustained injuries to her face and abdomen. The case was immediately reported to the police, but the accused were granted bail shortly afterwards. This case began as a dispute over property legally owned by the victim s mother and deceased father, wherein the late father s extended family are currently making claims over it and taking out their entitlement on the victim to the extent that they assaulted her, said WMACA director Miranda Friedmann. According to Friedmann, while such disputes are common among families, the vicious attack on the teen was unacceptable. Friedmann said this was not the first time the paternal family had appeared in court for violence and intimidation, and that they continued to threaten Mbali and her mother even after they were arrested. They have continued to verbally attack her, threatening and intimidating her and her mother. The accused live in close proximity to the victim and she is forced to see them daily, said Friedmann. The proceedings were postponed to December 8 to give Mbali time to finish her end-of-year exams and for her to testify. * Not her real name [email&#160;protected]The Star
