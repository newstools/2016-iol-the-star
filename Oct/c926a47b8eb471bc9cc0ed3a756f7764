Johannesburg - Vicki Momberg may be expected to pay a R150 000 fine to the Equality Court and has even offered to plead guilty in the criminal case for her racist rant, but the State has insisted that a trial date be set for the real estate agent.Momberg became infamous earlier this year after a video emerged of her verbally attacking police officers assisting her following a smash-and-grab incident.Throwing around swear words and racial slurs, Momberg has since been charged with four counts of crimen injuria in the Randburg Magistrate&#x2019;s Court.On Thursday, Momberg appeared in court, where her case had been marked down for a final postponement. For the past few appearances, Momberg&#x2019;s defence lawyer, Nardus Grove, indicated he will be filing a Section 105 plea application, wherein the agent is likely to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence.While it&#x2019;s not clear if the State is willing to accept the application, Grove told the court yesterday that he was still awaiting expert reports before he could complete the Section 105 deal.Thus far, a psychiatrist has already written a report on Momberg&#x2019;s behaviour, but according to Grove, a criminologist&#x2019;s report is still outstanding.He told the court that he still had to make representations next month to the Equality Court, where Momberg has been requested by the South African Human Rights Commission to be fined R150 000.However, prosecutor Yusuf Baba was unimpressed with Grove&#x2019;s request to postpone the case until after the representations had been made. He insisted that with so many postponements thus far, without the plea deal application, a trial date had to be set.He said the State would consider the application if it materialised, but indicated he was ready for trial, with seven witnesses and key evidence of video and recordings.
