Johannesburg - So greatly has the number of passengers increased on the Gautrain, that the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport has decided to purchase 12 new trains.Passenger figures on the Gautrain have already reached levels only predicted for 2020.Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi on Thursday announced that plans are at an advanced stage to acquire new trains for the Gautrain system.&#x201C;This is due to passenger demand that is exceeding realistic expectations, particularly during peak hours. The acquisition of 12 new trains over the next 24 months will help to alleviate congestion that Gautrain passengers experience in the morning and evening peaks,&#x201D; said Vadi.He indicated that several proposals were received in March this year from potential train manufacturing companies.&#x201C;These were evaluated and I am pleased to announce the three successful pre-qualified bidders for the new rolling stock project, namely, Bombardier Transportation, CRRC E-Loco Supply and Egoli Rail Consortium,&#x201D; said Vadi.In addition to the acquisition of more trains, the project entails the development of new depot facilities and the upgrading of the existing Gautrain signaling system.Jack van der Merwe, chief executive of the Gautrain Management Agency, said that the request for proposals will be issued later next month.&#x201C;It is projected that the final milestone &#x2013; the financial close - is to take place towards end 2017,&#x201D; said Van der Merwe.The new train project is expected to have a significant and positive socio-economic impact in the province as the Gauteng provincial government will insist on at least 65 percent local content by the successful bidder.It is also expected to sustain 10 000 jobs in Gauteng and total government revenue is to increase by an estimated R542 million in nominal terms between 2019 and 2023. Furthermore, an estimated R206 million is expected to be received by lower income households. [email&#160;protected] @annacox The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
