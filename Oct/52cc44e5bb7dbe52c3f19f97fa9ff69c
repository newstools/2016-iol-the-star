Johannesburg - And so the fascinating story that captured the imagination of thousands of Joburgers last month - the development of underground postal tunnels - grows.The Star broke the story last month about the possible development of the tunnels into pedestrianised walkways with parks, coffee shops and restaurants.This week, the paper tracked down a former Transnet employee who says there are not only other legs to the tunnels, one running right underneath Rissik Street, and another to the Rotunda, but also a bullion safe in the bowels of Park Station in which gold bars were stored before being transported by rail.Bart Zaayman, who worked for Transnet for 42 years, says the Rissik Street tunnel runs from under 96 Rissik Street, the headquarters of the former SA Railways and Harbours (now Transnet), directly to the Rissik Street post office.And there is yet another tunnel from an underground mail sorting room in Loveday Street, next to the headquarters, which runs straight to the Rotunda, a terminal for coaches to the airport, that transported the mail.The Rissik Street tunnel was the first built in the 1930s and post was transported in small, motorised carts from the post office to the mailroom, from where it went through different tunnels to the various destination platforms at Park Station.The Jeppe Street post office link was constructed in the 1950s and modern conveyor belts were installed to move the mail.Since The Star broke the story, there had been great excitement from the public, government departments and the private sector, said Ray Harli, director of Urbansoup architects who are investigating the possibility of opening the tunnels as a tourist attraction.Harli said the Rissik Street tunnels, which were not planned for initially as he didn t know they existed, would also be considered as part of the development of the tunnels.He said he had had hundreds of calls from people wanting to get involved with the project. In fact, he has a meeting planned with Renney Plit of the Affordable Housing Company, which owns the old Jeppe Street post office, next week.The building is being converted into housing with a retail component. The Jeppe Street post office has two entrances - one going to Rissik Street and one to Kaserne, he pointed out.There had been a bit of a frenzy since The Star published the story, he said. I have had calls from all sorts of radio and television stations, including Chinese, French and German TV stations, he said.In the meantime, things are progressing fast with an initial report on the state of the tunnels to be released before the end of October. We have engineers who worked on some of the problematic Gautrain tunnels who are working on it. They will establish whether the tunnels are inhabitable before we get too excited. They will be looking at waterproofing them if necessary and their structural and safety viability. The development would have to be in a private/public partnership, he said. Given all the enthusiasm, the indications are that there will be enormous support. [email&#160;protected]The Star
