The Class of 2016Johannesburg - &#x201C;Photography is the only language that can be understood anywhere in the world.&#x201D;These words by Magnum Photo Agency photojournalist Bruno Barbey encapsulate what The Star&#x2019;s photographic department strives towards.To tell South African stories in ways that words fail to fully convey.Over the years, we&#x201D;ve had stellar lensmen coming through our doors - from the legendary Alf Kumalo, Joao Silva, Jillian Edelstein and Ken Oosterbroek to contemporary photographers such as Jodi Bieber, Neo Ntsoma and Debbie Yazbek.We strive to continue the legacy of all the icons who have worked from our prominent Sauer (now Pixley Seme) Street building by giving talented, up-and-coming photographers the space and support to do their best work.The renowned French photographer and film-maker Yann Arthus-Bertrand said: &#x201C;The Earth is an art, a photographer is only a witness.&#x201D;Photographers are often in the front row of trauma and tragedy in everyday South Africa, and after witnessing the horrors, they capture it and then sport invisible scars after the work is done.This is the sacrifice that many make selflessly in pursuit of painting a true picture of the state of the nation.But it&#x2019;s not all ugly at the face of photojournalism.With light as palette and a camera as a paintbrush, photojournalists create art out of everyday sights and bring them to our eyes to teach us to see South Africa in a different way.We are lucky to have had many photo essays, projects and picture books come from current and former Star photographers.We&#x201D;re hoping that this exhibition is another step towards solidifying our contribution to The Star&#x2019;s legacy.
