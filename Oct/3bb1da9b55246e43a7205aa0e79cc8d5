Johannesburg - A large group of Wits University students continued their protest action for free tertiary education on Monday morning.Over one hundred protesting students danced and sang their way across Wits campus this morning, with some disrupting lectures as the university tried to once again re-open its doors.Many of the students then left their classes.A student who declined to be named said she wanted classes to resume as she feared she wouldn't complete her academic programme in time. Although she said she was not forced out of the class, the student decided to leave on her own accord as she didn't want to be the victim of an altercation from the protesters.A large police contingent were stationed around the university but didn't take any drastic steps to disperse the crowds yet.University management took the decision at the weekend that classes there would resume on Monday after an attempt to open its doors failed last week when violence erupted between the police and protesting students.Several of them sustained injuries at the time when rocks were hurled and several rounds of rubber bullets and stun grenades were fired.The university said as the classes continue, students could continue their protests but only at designated areas.They added that students who were caught carrying any weapons would be suspended.Despite this, many of the protesters carried sticks as they marched. Violent student protests erupted since last month when government announced a 2017 fee increase.Students have since insisted that they would continue their plight until their demand for free tertiary education was met.
