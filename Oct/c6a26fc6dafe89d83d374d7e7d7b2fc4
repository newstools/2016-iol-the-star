Johannesburg - How many uses can one have for a sexy billboard poster?While many of us may not have an answer on that, someone who took their time to remove one off the N1 Highway definitely has an idea.The billboard - a big, purple advert for the upcoming Sexpo - was stolen this week.It was a 4.5m x 18m advert. Rather large for someone to roll it up and take home, no? Maybe it was the big fat pink kiss that attracted the thief? Or maybe the idea of anyone else but them going to the Sexpo sent them into a sweat.Will we ever know? Probably not.Sexpo boss Sean Newman is thinking of putting up a reward for the missing billboard. &#x201C;Someone must have been incredibly dedicated to go through all that hassle,&#x201D; he said.According to Newman, the poster was protected by barbed wire.&#x201C;I have to give them 10 points for the effort; they managed to get past all of that. I&#x2019;m convinced it is on someone&#x2019;s rooftop right now to help keep out the summer rains.&#x201D;He said he hoped the thief would have a dry house and enjoy the graphics as well.The only positive that has come out of the &#x201C;mystery of the missing billboard&#x201D; is how it has become a great conversation point. &#x201C;People keep asking me: they stole your what? I&#x2019;m still shocked actually.&#x201D;The billboard will cost R6 500 to print again. The cost of the advertising space is R30 000.&#x201C;All I ask, if I do put the ad up again, is for the thief to please wait until next week Sunday night (when the Sexpo ends) to take it down, otherwise I may not even put it up,&#x201D; joked Newman.Of course the disappearing advert hasn&apos;t adversely affected interest in the biggest health, sexuality and lifestyle expo in the country.&#x201C;The Sexpo is going ahead. There is a big buzz around it. People are happy with the new line-up and what&#x2019;s in store this year,&#x201D; said Newman.The only question he had about the theft of the billboard was: How on earth did no one see it happen?The Sexpo will run from October 27-30 at the Nasrec Expo Centre.
