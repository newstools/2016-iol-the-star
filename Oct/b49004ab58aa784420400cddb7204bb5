Polokwane - Four men, arrested for inhumanely transporting donkeys that were allegedly destined for skinning, have each been sentenced to eight months&apos; imprisonment without the option of a fine.They were sentenced in the Polokwane Magistrate&apos;s Court on Wednesday, sending a stern message to donkey-hide traders that the practice wouldn&apos;t be tolerated.Sougson Manasseh, Madhihwa Mjasha, Target Murima and Amoni Chirwa pleaded guilty to the charges of cruelty to animals.The four, all foreigners, were additionally sentenced to two months&apos; imprisonment, to run concurrently with the eight months, for residing illegally in South Africa.Grace de Lange of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the organisation was pleased with the verdict.&#x201C;A strong message has been relayed that animal cruelty will not be tolerated. The NSPCA applauds the magistrate and the State prosecutor who acted swiftly and have been instrumental in ensuring justice was served.&#x201D;De Lange said the organisation was horrified by the manner in which donkeys were transported in a vehicle travelling from Limpopo to an abattoir in Randfontein, south-west of Joburg.&#x201C;Forty-one donkeys were loaded on to a truck that had slippery metal flooring and makeshift wooden pole side-rails. Adult males, females and foals were all in the same compartment with most of the animals in a state of collapse; crushed, dead or dying,&#x201D; said De Lange.The vehicle was intercepted by personnel from the Polokwane SPCA and the animals humanely euthanised.The four men were arrested and imprisoned.They had been denied bail.A demand for donkey skins in the East for medical purposes has emerged in recent months in South Africa. The hide of donkeys contains a gelatine that&apos;s valued for its supposed medicinal benefits.The SPCA said that according to the China Daily newspaper, &#x201C;it has anti-ageing properties, and an ability to treat insomnia and improve blood circulation&#x201D;.The gelatine is a key in-gredient in China&#x2019;s ejiao industry, which produces tablets, tonics and a sweet syrup. The skins are soaked and stewed to produce or release this substance. [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
