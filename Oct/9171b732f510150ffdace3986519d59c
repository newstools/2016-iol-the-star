Pretora - The future of suspended deputy national director of public prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba lies in the hands of President Jacob Zuma, after her lawyers vowed to help her keep her job.Zuma has asked Jiba and another senior prosecutor, advocate Lawrence Mrwebi, to make representations to him on why they should not be suspended, pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.Lawyers for Jiba said on Sunday they would write to Zuma on Monday to provide reasons why their client should not be suspended.Jiba and Mrwebi were struck off the roll of advocates by the high court in Pretoria last month after a complaint by the General Council of the Bar.The high court made a scathing judgment against the two prosecutors for failing to prosecute former police spy boss Richard Mdluli.Zuma called for Jiba and Mrwebi to make representations on why they should not be suspended pending the inquiry.Zuma tried to have an inquiry against former NPA chief Mxolisi Nxasana, but it was dropped at the last minute after the two parties reached a settlement.This was on a different matter after reports emerged that Nxasana was caught in a fight with Zuma.Allegations about his past then emerged, but the inquiry was dropped after Nxasana was reported to have received an R18m golden handshake.Neither party confirmed the amounts involved.Another former NPA head, Menzi Simelane, lost his job after the Constitutional Court found his appointment by Zuma was invalid. The court found that Zuma had not considered evidence before him, including that of the Ginwala Commission of Inquiry and the Public Service Commission&#x2019;s report, before appointing Simelane in 2009.Simelane lost his job in 2012 when the Constitutional Court made the damning judgment.Zuma will now have to consider the representations by Jiba and Mrwebi.It is not clear what reasons Jiba&#x2019;s lawyers will give when they submit them to the president.Zuma said he would make up his mind on the matter once he had received the reasons from the two prosecutors.After they were struck off the roll, the two prosecutors asked that they be put on special leave by the head of the NPA, Shaun Abrahams.Abrahams told MPs three weeks ago that it was the decision of Mrwebi and Jiba to be put on special leave after they had approached him.
