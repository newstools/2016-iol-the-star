Johannesburg - The Ekurhuleni house where Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa was murdered was quiet on Tuesday as neighbours carried on with their daily routine.Children were seen playing on a pavement while others casually strolled down the streets.But just two years ago to the day, the same road in Spruitview, Katlehong, was filled with hundreds of people flocking to Kutlwanong Street to mourn the death of Meyiwa, who was also the Orlando Pirates goalkeeper.On that Sunday afternoon on October 26, 2014 Meyiwa was gunned down in an alleged botched robbery at the house of the mother of his girlfriend, singer and actress Kelly Khumalo.Khumalo and her family, including her mother Ntombi and sister Zandi, were at the house at the time of the shooting. Others also at the scene were the son of music producer Chicco Twala, Longwe, and Meyiwa&#x2019;s friends Tumelo Madlala and Mthokozisi Twala.When The Star visited the premises on Tuesday, the occupants of the house were nowhere to be seen. But the words &#x201C;Spaza&#x201D; painted on the side of the facebrick house since the time the Khumalo family lived there remains. The lawn is neatly kept and a large steel gate greets those who stand in the driveway.A neighbour said he would often see the soccer star visit the house. &#x201C;He was a cool guy, he would always greet us when he saw us, he didn&#x2019;t act like a celebrity,&#x201D; said the neighbour, who declined to be named.Following the shooting, Khumalo&#x2019;s family decided to sell the house, and the neighbour said he seldom sees the new owners.&#x201C;They are quiet and carry on with their business, we don&#x2019;t really see them,&#x201D; the neighbour said.According to media reports, the family struggled to sell the house as potential buyers would decline to buy the property when they realised that it was where Meyiwa was killed.According to police information, the goalkeeper was killed when two armed men allegedly entered the house and demanded money, cellphones and other valuables.Although no one has been brought to book for the murder, a panama hat was identified at the scene and there was hope that the owner could reveal more about what occurred at the time.
