Johannesburg - Two of Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir&#x2019;s co-accused blamed the State for an alleged conspiracy against them, demanding a new prosecutor for their numerous criminal cases.Krejcir, Siboniso Miya, Nkanyiso Mafunda, Siphiwe Memela and Borislavov Grigorov have been charged with the 2013 murder of alleged Bedfordview drug kingpin Sam Issa.The trial was meant to start in April in the high court in Joburg but was delayed by disclosure of evidence by the State and a constant shuffle of defence legal representation.Last week, the case was postponed to give Krejcir another chance to assign a new advocate, after his previous representative, James Grant, withdrew last month.Miya also needed a new advocate after asking his attorney Sinen Mnguni to withdraw.On Monday in court, it was revealed that Jacques Pienaar would be taking over to represent Miya. He was, however, unavailable on Monday.Miya and Memela complained to the court that prosecutor, Lawrence Gcaba had headed the prosecution on two of Memela&#x2019;s criminal trials, and four of Miya&#x2019;s.Miya believed that would prejudice him.Memela asked Judge Winston Msimeki to ask for a new prosecutor.The judge said he didn&#x2019;t wish to venture into other cases over which he hadn&#x2019;t presided and that the pair should use their lawyers to make representations to the National Prosecuting Authority.Krejcir&#x2019;s lawyer Frank Cohen revealed that the issue of funds, which had been the reason Krejcir lost several lawyers, appears to have been resolved.The case was postponed to Monday. If Krejcir still doesn&#x2019;t have a lawyer, he might have to represent himself. [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
