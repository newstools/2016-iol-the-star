Johannesburg - The State Capture report not only brings shady dealings to light but it also makes for riveting reading, especially the gritty repartee between the former public protector and the president&apos;s attorney, Michael Hulley.Thuli Madonsela lost her cool a number of times as her frustration grew due to Hulley&#x2019;s insistence on speaking on behalf of President Jacob Zuma. This was after she repeatedly told him that &#x201C;the president has a right to legal assistance, not legal representation&#x201D;.Hulley didn&#x2019;t seem to understand this, so Madonsela just had to keep putting him in his place. The dialogue, which is captured in a compelling 90-page annexure accompanying the report, shows that though Madonsela tried to be patient, Hulley&#x2019;s interruptions and interjections had her quite irked.Michael Hulley, the president&apos;s attorneyThe tone of the dialogue began changing when Hulley asked, early on in the sitting, why Madonsela was &#x201C;rushing&#x201D; the proceedings.&#x201C;Well, maybe we should just cut to the chase and find out why there is a rush? With respect let&#x2019;s find out why it is that you are rushing it out of your own (indistinct &#x2013; speaking simultaneously)?&#x201D; he said.Madonsela began her response by saying: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m rushing it because I&apos;m the Public Protector until the 14th of October. I&#x2019;m rushing it because I am supposed to have finished this matter within 30 days. I&#x2019;m rushing it because I have institutional memory relating this case&#x2026;&#x201C;She goes on to list more reasons, to which Hulley says: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure that personalities bring with them their own style and their own manner of doing things.&#x201D; Madonsela does not fall into the trap. &#x201C;Sir, can we not deal with that?&#x201D;Later, the back-and-forth grows icier.Hulley says: &#x201C;Can I just carry on making the submissions that I had started making?&#x201D;&#x201C;I thought you had concluded, Sir?&#x201D; Madonsela replies, to which Hulley said: &#x201C;No, I hadn&#x2019;t, I was interrupted.&#x201D;Soon the confrontation was nearing its peak.An annoyed Madonsela said in response to Hulley&#x2019;s interjection: &#x201C;You have made that representation. I have now made a ruling that we are going to proceed, but we will focus on the things that the President is going to answer. I&#x2019;m sorry sir, I cannot be bullied by you...&#x201D;Hulley then appears to retreat: &#x201C;I beg your pardon, if that is the impression, I apologise.&#x201D;The final phrase that shut Hulley up for the rest of the sitting was a fist on the table from Madonsela, stating she had had enough.&#x201D;Please can you not stop... can you stop talking for the president? Mister Hulley, I&#x2019;m forbidding you from speaking. I&#x2019;m not giving you an opportunity. I&#x2019;m asking Mister President to address me.&#x201D;From then on, Zuma was forced to answer.
