Johannesburg - Cosatu has endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramphosa to take over the reins of the ANC.Following a central executive committee meeting this week, Cosatu general-secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said on Thursday that the federation would lobby and influence ANC structures to support its call. We are mindful of the fact that we are not a voting structure of the ANC but we represent workers, who are members and supporters of the ANC, he told reporters in Johannesburg.The federation also warned the ANC that it was not a junior member of the tripartite alliance.This followed ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa chastising the federation's affiliates for calling on President Jacob Zuma to step down. We shall work to ensure that such attitudes do not persist from any of our alliance partners because if this is not properly managed it has the potential of leading to the disintegration of the alliance..., said Ntshalintshali.Labour Bureau
