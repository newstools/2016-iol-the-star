Johannesburg - The announcement on Tuesday of a R20 million fund from the Gauteng government to relocate residents affected by the floods has come too late for the family of the Alexandra child swept away two weeks ago.A body was found on Tuesday by a worker near the Jukskei River in Buccleuch, Sandton, and it s thought to be that of the three-year-old Everite Chauke.The child was swept away after her home next to the Jukskei River was flooded, when by raging floods flattened parts of Alexandra.Her father, Shadrick Chauke, had climbed up a tree with her but the branch they were sitting on broke and he lost his grip on her.A team of rescuers scoured the river and its tributaries and went as far as Hartbeespoort Dam without finding her body.Although there was no official confirmation on Tuesday night that it was her body, the discovery has brought the Chauke family closer to hoping that it s her body.While they have given up hope of finding her alive, they have longed for closure and to finally have a body they bury.Solomon Makhamu stumbled across a child s body next to the Jukskei River in Buccleuch. Shocked and unsure of what he was seeing, Makhamu took a closer look to make sure his eyes weren t deceiving him.Makhamu, who works in one of the residential buildings in Buccleuch, near the Jukskei, said: During the floods, the toilets we use were washed away, so we start-ed using this tree to do our business. It was about 11am when I went to the tree. There was a terrible smell, something was off and that s when I saw the feet. There were pieces of tree and grass in between her legs, he said. They (the feet) were light brown and swollen; it was definitely a baby girl. She was lying face-down in the dirt, he said.Still shocked, he ran to alert his co-workers, who, in turn, called the police.The area where Makhamu pointed to was on the bank of the river quite steep and high up from where it flowed. It was dense with trees, almost like entering a dark forest .DNA tests will be conducted to determine whether the body is Everite s.On Tuesday, The Star team arrived just minutes after forensic service officers removed the corpse.Wrapped in a small white plastic body-bag, lying on the rocky ground, the outline of a small body could be seen.The mood was sombre as the bodybag was loaded into the van and taken to the morgue.In Alexandra, a member of Gift of the Givers, who identified himself only as Mike, said Everite s parents had just arrived back from their daily counselling session. They ve been notified that a little girl s body has been found and that it could be Everite. However they re in a very fragile state, he said, adding that the parents would go to the morgue on Wednesday to identify the body.Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said they would confirm the identity of the child once the family had identified the body.He called on the people who reported missing children during the flash floods to contact police.A total of R20m has been allocated to the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs to help those affected by the flash floods.@June_Hlongwane1; @Lanc_02The Star
