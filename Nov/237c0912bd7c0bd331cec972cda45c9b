Johannesburg - Matrics have entered the last week of writing their final exams. On Monday, the Grade 12 pupils wrote agricultural sciences paper 2 and nautical science paper 2 in the morning and dramatic arts and mechanical technology in the afternoon. Last week, the police arrested a Limpopo man in connection with leaking a maths exam paper. On Thursday, Tinyiko Khosa, 52, appeared in the Giyani Magistrate s Court for leaking the paper, which was distributed among matric pupils. The paper was allegedly leaked from Gauteng to Limpopo via WhatsApp.Khosa has been charged with corruption and fraud. Last year, the messaging platform was also used to leak the physical science paper in the Vhembe district of Limpopo. Candidates had to rewrite the exam due to the leak, and two pupils were implicated. A statement by the Department of Basic Education last week said only a few candidates who had access to the leaked paper would be asked to rewrite. The department has still not concluded an investigation into the 2014 group cheating scandal in 57 schools in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.At least 100 pupils at Mashiyamahle High School in Ndwedwe in northern KwaZulu-Natal are still awaiting their results, and have denied cheating. They took the department to court, but the matter has not been finalised.Department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said the department was now racing against time to review exam security systems before the year-end. The task team have to give the minister recommendations by the end of the year. Mhlanga said he believed the department would, through working closely with the Hawks, curb the leaks. On Tuesday, candidates were due to write business studies paper 3.[email&#160;protected]The Star
