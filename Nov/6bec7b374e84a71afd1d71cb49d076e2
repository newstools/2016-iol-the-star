Johannesburg - The National Director of Public Prosecutions, advocate Shaun Abrahams, may soon give reasons why he shouldn&apos;t be suspended.But an analyst has warned against factional battles in the ANC cutting short the term of National Prosecuting Authority bosses.Abrahams remained mum on Tuesday on what he planned to do after President Jacob Zuma asked Abrahams to give him reasons why he shouldn&apos;t be suspended pending an inquiry into his fitness to hold office.Zuma confirmed that his decision followed the request by the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law for the suspension of Abrahams.This followed decisions by Abrahams first to lay and then to drop charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Head of politics at Unisa Professor Dirk Kotze warned on Tuesday of the dangers of NPA heads not completing their full 10-year term due to ANC factional battles.Kotze said the NPA boss&apos;s term was averaging two to three years in office, and this had to stop.The last NPA boss to quit was Mxolisi Nxasana, who left with a golden handshake of R17.8 million after 18 months on the job.Kotze said the ANC had to break this vicious cycle of NPA chiefs leaving early. He said the notice to suspend Abrahams came after a similar action on his deputies Lawrence Mrwebi and Nomgcobo Jiba.The fact that none of the previous heads of the NPA finished their terms was raising alarm bells.&#x201D;If you look at the terms of office of the eight previous national directors of public prosecutions in the past 18 years, their term is between two to three years,&#x201D; he pointed out.&#x201D;It&#x2019;s an indication how volatile the situation in the NPA is. It is because they are often confronted with difficult decisions like charging Zuma in the spy tapes and Gordhan in the Sars rogue unit.&#x201D;Many of the people prosecuted in high-profile cases were politically connected individuals. Kotze said whoever was going to succeed Zuma must break this cycle of using state security agencies to target opponents.&#x201D;The next ANC leader must stop this cycle, otherwise it will continue to fester in the political system like it has in the past 18 years.&#x201D;Abrahams faced a massive backlash after he decided to stop the prosecution of Gordhan. This was after an outcry that the minister had been politically pursued. But Abrahams denied in Parliament there was a political agenda to charge Gordhan.In Parliament last week, he also denied that a meeting at Luthuli House with ANC ministers had anything to do with charging Gordhan. Zuma, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha and Abrahams confirmed the meeting, but said it was to discuss violent student protests at universities.Opposition parties said they were concerned that Zuma, Abrahams, Masutha and other ministers would discuss such security matters at Luthuli House.Political Bureau IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
