Johannesburg - The company that manages the building where a University of Johannesburg (UJ) student was killed has denied claims that the killer was a security guard.Afhco property management contacted The Star on Monday seeking to clarify the issue.Twenty-one-year-old Kelvin Baloyi was shot and killed in the early hours of Saturday during a party at a private student residence, according to the police.Afhco threw an end-of-year party for students residing at the building, under The Yards brand, after acquiring the property three months ago.According to Afhco managing director Kevin van den Heever, the security company said the assailant was not their employee.&#x201C;He (the assailant) arrived at site at the same time as two additional uniformed but unarmed security guards. He was plain-clothed and armed; we&#x2019;re still trying to understand how he got in and under what pretences,&#x201D; Van den Heever said.He said the two additional security guards were brought in especially for the party and were accompanied by their supervisor.&#x201C;At about 1am, the party was coming to an end, and it seems the students wanted to proceed to the roof for the party to continue.&#x201C;An altercation broke out between a student or group of students and the armed individual which escalated,&#x201D; he said.Van den Heever said this was the first time Afhco was throwing the party for students, adding the previous owners of the building had done so every year in the past.&#x201C;We only provide the food, entertainment and cooldrinks; we don&#x2019;t supply alcohol, however. The students do their own thing,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;We are co-operating with the SAPS in investigating the matter,&#x201D; Van den Heever said.Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Noxolo Kweza said on Monday that the police were continuing their search for a man who they believed could assist with investigations.Baloyi was registered for a BSc computer science and informatics in the faculty ofscience.&#x201C;UJ management have met with the family to express our sincerest condolences,&#x201D; the university management said, adding they were &#x201C;saddened by the death of one of our students who was fatally shot&#x201D;.UJ said the police were investigating the incident.Meanwhile, in a separate incident over the weekend, two UJ students drowned while river rafting at Intundla Game Lodge and Bush Spa, situated north of Pretoria.UJ management said 44 students were attending an awards and team-building event organised by a UJ day house.&#x201C;Eight students acted in their own capacity to go river rafting, which was not on the official programme. It is believed the raft capsized, resulting in the drowning of the two students,&#x201D; management said. [email&#160;protected] @Lanc_02 The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
