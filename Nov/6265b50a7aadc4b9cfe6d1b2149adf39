Johannesburg - The man who stabbed a Soweto primary school principal had faked his matric and teacher&#x2019;s diploma and managed to get a teaching post in the country.When he was caught, he was suspended for a year and later fired. However, he still wanted his job back at Paul Mosaka Primary School in Pimville, and pestered the principal for re-employment.The principal always refused, and on Monday, the man, a foreign national, went to the school and stabbed her at least 10 times in full view of pupils and staff. He also hit her with a brick.Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school on Tuesday to reassure the pupils that they would get all the support they need after some of them witnessed the stabbing.It is not known how the man managed to secure a job with the fake documents, and Lesufi said those were some of the irregularities that embarrassed the department.It was found that the man had in fact used someone else&#x2019;s diploma, passed it off as his own, and went on to teach Sesotho and economic management sciences at the school.The truth behind his qualifications came to light after parents complained about his inappropriate manner of teaching their children. Lesufi said the district office had gone through the files to determine the kind of qualifications the teacher had and what support to give him. It was then that they discovered that his qualifications were fraudulent.&#x201C;He was given six moths to go and get the original documents. He flatly refused and that&#x2019;s when we instituted disciplinary processes. The district and school tried to provide the relevant support. He was suspended for two months without a salary for misconduct and there were various cases he was involved in,&#x201D; Lesufi said.&#x201C;He was kicked out of the school for almost a year and was to report at district office. The district gave me that information, saying MEC, we tried&#x2019;.&#x201D;Lesufi said the district officials even went to the police when the harassment started but the police would come and say &#x201C;but if he hasn&#x2019;t attacked anyone or disrupted schooling. If you say we should come here as the police, what do you expect us to do?&#x201D;On Tuesday, some parents waited outside the school gate, worried about the safety of their children after the incident. Among them was Benjy*, who witnessed Monday&#x2019;s attack on the principal moments after he had dropped his six-year-old child at school.&#x201C;The teacher was on top of the principal, stabbing her. She was screaming uyangibulala lomuntu&#x2019; (he is busy killing me). The teacher was busy talking as he was stabbing her. He was so violent and when I looked at him, he looked like he was crazy,&#x201D; Benjy said. Not his real name [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
