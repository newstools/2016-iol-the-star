Johannesburg -The Democratic Alliance has welcomed the resignation of Ekurhuleni Metro Department traffic chief, Bafana Mahlabe.Controversy has surrounded his tenure since he took up the position just over a year ago.It is alleged that even though he has four security guards at his private home, he recently approved overtime for nine security officials at an additional 84 hours per month to guard his home. Mr Mahlabe already has five guards patrolling his private residence, and the DA has in its possession a letter requesting an additional four. Amongst their duties, the police chief has tasked the security officers to take his wife to the doctor and to run his children to school on a regular basis, said Michele Clark, DA Gauteng MPL.Insisting that security personnel take care of his domestic affairs is an abuse of public resources and the DA will insist that community safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, investigate his conduct as a matter of urgency, said Clarke.Further concerns were that he was never a member of the metro police and his appointment was flawed.Announcing the resignation on Wednesday, Ekuthuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina said Mahlabe wishes to pursue business interests.In the meantime, General Isaac Mapiyeye will be acting as police chief from December 1.Ekurhuleni has experienced numerous problems with traffic chiefs in the past, the most controversial being Robert McBride who was arrested and convicted of drunk driving and attempting to defeat the ends of justice in 2011. In 2013, he won his appeal against the convictions.@annacoxThe Star
