Johannesburg - The Johannesburg Roads Agency has warned motorists to be careful as many of the city&#x2019;s bridges have been damaged or destroyed.JRA managing director Sean Phillips said on Friday morning that the flash floods earlier this week were an act of God and &#x201C;beyond the capacity of JRA stormwater systems&#x201D;.&#x201C;The road surface and reserve, including the stormwater servitude, is designed to act as a channel if the underground system reaches capacity while major system (underground drainage) including crossings through residential properties, are designed for storms statistically happening once every 25 years.&quot;Joburg rivers have 1:50 year and 1:100 year floodlines below which buildings cannot be erected.&#x201C;Unfortunately, any severe storm or flash flooding that occurs will result in isolated flooding as the road infrastructure is not designed for these severities,&#x201D; he said.The agency is currently assessing the damage to infrastructure, clearing debris, silt and other obstructions to the roads, bridges and stormwater drainage systems.Phillips said the JRA has inspected recurring blockages in the areas which are termed as flooding hotspots and is monitoring low level bridges prone to over topping during heavy downpour.He emphasised that maintenance to stormwater drains is being carried by JRA on a regular basis. Repairs to damaged stormwater drains and blocked stormwater drains are also prioritised.Work is under way to identify damaged infrastructure, which includes: Witkoppen road, which is damaged R55 in Kyalami,where a bridge collapsed Linksfield Road, off-ramp and on ramp to N3 Corner Louis Botha Avenue and Houghton Drive, where a wall collapsed Siyabusa (Rabie Ridge), which is flooding due to insufficient stormwater system capacity All low-lying bridges between Kyalami and Dainfern which are flooded The Joburg Zoo wall which collapsed next to Jan Smuts Avenue M1 South run off from Houghton side to M1 South near AGSA office (debris and rocks on the road) Alexandra, where the John Nhlanhla bridge washed away Buccleuch Bridge also washed awayMember of the mayoral committee for transport Nonhlanhla Makhuba said the JRA has also developed a Soweto stormwater masterplan.This highlights areas where stormwater drains needs to be implemented at a cost of R4 billion.The JRA is also developing an inner city stormwater masterplan.&#x201C;Motorists are urged to obey road signs, traffic signals and especially road closures due to flooded bridges or unsafe driving conditions which are unsafe to traverse. In the event of a flash flood, or where residents are at risk, it is advisable to immediately evacuate the area and seek a place of safety,&#x201D; she said.Residents and road users are encouraged to report all road and storm related emergencies to 0860 562 874/ [email&#160;protected] / twitter @MyJra or JRA Find&amp;Fix mobile app. [email&#160;protected] @annacox The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
