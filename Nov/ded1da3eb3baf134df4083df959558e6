Johannesburg - Absolutely fine was how Mohan Hira described his state after 48 hours of fasting - and he was confident that he would achieve his goal of 70 hours without food or water.The 78-year-old Lenasia re-sident has been fasting in an attempt to raise money for the alleviation of hunger.He planned to break the fast at 1pm today.&quot;I&apos;m looking forward to some water and soup,&quot; said the karate teacher, who weighs 70kg.Hira began his challenge on Friday in the court outside the Edgars store at Trade Route Mall in Lenasia.He chatted readily to passers-by from his armchair.Gift of the Givers (GOTG) has partnered with Hira to create awareness about poverty and hunger. Donations towards his mission will go to the Helen Joseph Hospital kitchen, which costs GOTG R160 000 a month to keep running.&quot;The people have been great. I just want to get the message out there that so many people don&apos;t have food, especially children. I&apos;ve seen so many in the hospitals who can&apos;t get a meal,&quot; said Hira, who uses a caravan behind the GOTG station at the mall to sleep.Hira completed 67 hours of fasting three years ago to bring awareness to world peace.One of his supporters, Fakir Hassen, said Hira had always been interested in community issues.&quot;He is so humble and community minded.
