Johannesburg - &#x201C;Fallen flowers cannot come back... Dried leaves can never be fresh again... so don&#x2019;t think about the past... love the present and live for the future with hope in your heart...&#x201D;This is what a former Lotus FM DJ Faradh Patel reposted on Facebook last week. But now he is fighting for his life in hospital after being shot in an alleged botched hijacking on the M1 south highway on Monday night.The 42-year-old, who is currently station commander at online radio station Radio Mubarak and previously starred in the soapie Egoli, was gunned down while driving near the Johannesburg CBD.Patel, who is also a lifestyle and fashion correspondent, sustained injuries to his upper body and was in a critical condition when found by the police.A relative of the popular media personality said on Tuesday that he was taken to Netcare Garden City Hospital. Patel was out of the intensive care unit and his mother and brother were at his side and hoped he would make a full recovery.Patel was apparently travelling alone on the M1 South highway when his car broke down.Police spokesman Warrant Officer Jerbes de Bruyn said that Patel parked on the side of the highway about 300m from the Booysen&#x2019;s offramp when his car ran out of fuel.He was then accosted by a group of unidentified suspects. &#x201C;They shot him twice in the upper body and when police arrived he was unconscious,&#x201D; he said.De Bruyn said the gang responsible fled the scene. He was not able to say how many suspects were involved.It was believed the group tried to hijack Patel but could not take the vehicle as it had no fuel. De Bruyn said police were not yet sure if any of Patel&#x2019;s other possessions were stolen and would speak to him once he recovered.&#x201C;At this stage, only an attempted murder case has been opened and the matter is still under investigation,&#x201D; he said.A hunt has been launched for the suspects. Meanwhile, Patel&#x2019;s fans and loved ones took to his Facebook page to wish him a speedy recovery.Among them was Zarina Hoosen who wrote: &#x201C;Ya Allah!!
