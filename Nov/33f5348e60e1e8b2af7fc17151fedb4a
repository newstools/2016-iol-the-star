Johannesburg - Two more suspects have been arrested in connection with a spate of attacks on Uber passengers earlier this year.Meanwhile, a police officer who allegedly tried to help them derail the investigation has been arrested and charged with corruption.Two men were arrested in September after being linked to four case dockets relating to the rape and robbery of Uber clients.The Star has learnt that two more men have been arrested, one of whom was apparently identified in an ID parade by one of the victims.According to sources close to the investigation, the suspects had initially been hiding out at Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal, before returning to Joburg this month to meet the police officer, whom they knew.The men allegedly asked the officer to facilitate a meeting with the investigating officer in the case, who was offered R4 000 to derail the investigation.However, The Star understands that the investigating officer, Captain Philip Radebe, immediately turned down the bribe, arrested the two alleged rapists and then arrested the police officer.The officer appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate&#x2019;s Court on November 7 on a corruption charge and was granted bail.The suspects were due to appear in the Randburg Magistrate&#x2019;s Court yesterday in a bail application hearing, but the matter was adjourned until Wednesday.In mid-October, the first two men linked to the case, including a former Uber driver, were denied bail in the same court after the presiding magistrate declared them a potential flight risk.Radebe&#x2019;s affidavit in their bail hearing indicated that police have a strong case against the two accused, as a SIM card from one of the victims was found in one of the men&#x2019;s cellphones.Other cellphone data had placed them at the crime scenes.The first two accused are due to appear in court again on December 6.Cop arrested for trying to quash investigation [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
