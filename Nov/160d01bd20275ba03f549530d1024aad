Johannesburg - On the eve of the 16 Days of Activism campaign, a group of women listened to stories of gender abuse survivors who have used their life experience to encourage others that sexual, emotional and physical abuse can be overcome. Hosted by the 1 000 Women Foundation, Thursday s event, held at ULP House in Midrand, raised awareness of the plight of victims, but stressed the fact that, as a survivor, adequate therapy and support were key components of the healing process.The head of the Tears Foundation, Mara Glennie, said her five-year-old initiative seeks to educate young women and girls, as well as boys and men, that sex has to be consensual. She added that part of the healing process was the sharing of stories, and it was important to get the message into the community.The women attending the lunch were made up of supporters of the 1 000 Women campaign and company sponsors such as Avon and Transman.Businesswoman and author Ronelle Harris told her story, encouraging the audience to follow their dreams and start living the life they deserve.Harris was abused by her father as a child. She said she was so excited to move to a welfare home when she was 12 because she knew it would change her life, not realising that because her mother had left her father, life was to get harder.Years later, after the heartbreaking loss of her husband at 19, she landed in an institution. All the pain and grief had been locked away, but I had one thing in my pocket, a dream. Harris said she made numerous sacrifices to get herself and her young son back on their feet, and today, aged 51, she has achieved a number of those dreams.Louise Niemann shared her story of growing up with an emotionally abusive father and sexual abuse at the hands of a family friend during her teenage years. She told the room full of mostly women that she came to a realisation in her 30s, following numerous failed relationships. I realised the only abusive relationship was the one I had with myself, said Niemann.She decided to dedicate her time and voice to transforming the self-image of society. She works as a coach, as well as being voted in as a finalist for Mrs Africa.Glennie said Tears offered unique services, including a helpline that offers callers immediate references to the closest trauma centres, as well as personal assistance when needed. They also have a board game which helps pupils understand the various aspects of consent.The Star
