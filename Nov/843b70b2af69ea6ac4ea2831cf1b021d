Johannesburg - Former ANC Youth League leader Patrick Wisani has been found guilty of murder in the high court sitting in Randburg.He was accused of beating his girlfriend, Nosipho Mandleleni to death with a broomstick and sjambok in September last year.Wisani was the chairperson of the ANCYL inner city branch at the time. The court rejects accused s version. He s convicted of all three counts as charged, said Judge Mohamed Ismail.Wisani was also found guilty of the lesser charges of assault and intimidation of state witness and Nosipho s twin sister, Siphokazi, and of her friend, Zimbini Mathibe.He allegedly assaulted the pair in May in an attempt to prevent Siphokazi from testifying against him in the murder trial.Siphokazi testified that Wisani had threatened to kill you like I did your sister if she gave evidence to the court.She also told the court how she heard her sister screaming in Wisani s room on the night of her murder.She reportedly went to Wisani s room and when he opened the door he was holding a bloodied broomstick in his hand.Wisani s trial came to an abrupt end in August after the presiding officer Judge Andre Louw recused himself.Wisani then went through a string of lawyers before deciding to represent himself in the trial.Throughout the judgment, Wisani sat with his head down in the dock taking notes. The gallery was packed with social activists wearing purple T-shirts with the words Stop violence against women printed on them.[email&#160;protected]@Gabi_FalangaThe Star
