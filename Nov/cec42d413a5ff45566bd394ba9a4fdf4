By Anna CoxJohannesburg - The City of Joburg has dispatched several teams to mop up after Wednesday&#x2019;s flash flood.The city mayor Herman Mashaba on Thursday morning offered condolences to affected residents and motorists and said the city was doing all it could to assist with the mop up.Relevant departments and entities are currently on the ground providing the following disaster response services, he said:Emergency management services are providing emergency medical care, as well as search and rescue services, to those injured and affected during the flash flood and ensuing damage.Disaster management is facilitating temporary accommodation and relief supplies to victims.The city&#x2019;s department of health and social development, in conjunction with NGOs and the provincial government are on the ground handing out blankets and food parcels to those who have tragically lost their belongings.The department of community development is opening community halls for those who have lost belongings to provide safe and dry shelter.The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) is out assessing the damage to infrastructure, clearing debris, silt and other obstructions to our roads, bridges and storm water drainage systems. The JRA is in the process of cleaning up all roads in the city littered by debris.&#x201C;Our city has experienced a flash flood beyond the capacity of our stormwater systems. Unfortunately, any severe storm or flash flooding that occurs will result in isolated flooding as the road infrastructure is not designed for these severities. However, I wish to assure the public that JRA is working tirelessly to resolve blockages and repair faulty traffic lights resulting from the flash flood. JMPD officers have also been deployed to assist with traffic control to affected intersections,&#x201D; he said.Mashaba thanked these entities and departments for the professional manner in which they are dealing with this situation, and their quick response to those affected. &#x201C;Our teams have been working throughout the night to provide assistance to the most vulnerable in our city.Today he will be visiting the Sandton Fire Station, which is being used as a briefing venue for departments and entities to coordinate and plan interventions and assistance.Thereafter he will be visiting Alexandra which has been one of the worst affected areas following the flash flood. It has been reported that close to 200 families lost their homes in Setswetla alone.&#x201C;Tragically, it is our poorest residents who are worst affected during these situations. This is something that has to be addressed during my term in office,&#x201D; he said. @annacox [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
