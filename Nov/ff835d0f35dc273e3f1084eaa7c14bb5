Johannesburg - The body of a girl found near the Jukskei River in Buccleuch, Sandton, was in such a state of terrible decomposition that doctors advised her suspected parents not to view the body. What is believed to be three-year-old Everite Chauke s body was being kept at the Hillbrow mortuary and forensic services, after it was found on Tuesday.Her parents, Shadrick and Cynthia Chauke, were first in line to identify her body on Wednesday after a call by police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele for people who had reported their children missing during recent floods to contact police.They arrived at the mortuary in the morning hoping for closure. Anxious, the couple, who were ushered in by a relative, sat in the waiting area as officials completed the necessary paperwork. Makhubele said that due to the state of the body, the Chaukes had been advised not to view it. The doctors have advised that they should take DNA of the child and the couple instead. The couple were on Wednesday prepared for what would have been their worst experience during a counselling session. They were told that they might not be able to view the body today (on Wednesday), so they understand the processes, Makhubele said. News on the results should be finalised as quickly as possible, and then we will be able to confirm the child s identity, he said.The Chaukes were visibly depressed as they left the mortuary. They will remain at the Gift of the Givers centre in Alexandra s Extension 19, together with several other residents who were displaced by the floods.[email&#160;protected]@June_Hlongwane1The Star
