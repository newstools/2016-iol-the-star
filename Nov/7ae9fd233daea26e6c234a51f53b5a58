Parliament - The ANC has deployed some of its senior MPs to form part of an ad hoc committee that will investigate the SABC&#x2019;s financial mess and the board&#x2019;s fitness to hold office.On Thursday, Parliament passed a resolution for the establishment of the committee. It is expected to complete its work early next year.The former chairperson of the ad hoc committee on the appointment of the public protector, Makhosi Khoza, is one of the members of the new committee. She was credited for a thorough process in picking the new public protector.Other ANC members in the ad hoc committee include Vincent Smith, who is a member of the standing committee on public accounts and the chairperson of the standing committee on the auditor-general.Smith will chair the ad hoc committee on the SABC probe if all parties agree to that.Among the other members of the committee are Jabulani Mahlangu, Fezeka Loliwe and Hlomane Chauke.Chauke is the portfolio committee on home affairs&#x2019; former chairperson.Loliwe serves as a member of the portfolio committee on labour.Former member of the portfolio committee on communications Juli Kilian will also sit on the committee.The SABC has had running battles with the communications committee over its finances and defying court decisions on corporate affairs general executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng.In a resolution in Parliament, it was agreed that the inquiry would get to the bottom of the troubles at the SABC, including looking into the damning findings of former public protector Thuli Madonsela.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said the problems facing the SABC were huge and had to be resolved urgently.The ad hoc committee is due to submit its report in Parliament before the end of February.Communications Minister Faith Muthambi this week shocked MPs in the National Council of Provinces when she said the three-member board of the SABC could take decisions despite not having the required nine-member quorum.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
