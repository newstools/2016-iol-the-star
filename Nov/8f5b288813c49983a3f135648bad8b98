Johannesburg - The blame game has started following Wednesday&#x2019;s flash floods which caused huge damage in Joburg and Ekurhuleni.Ekurhuleni councillor Jill Humphreys says she knew this would happen as there is frequent flooding in Bedfordview.&#x201C;I asked the roads and stormwater department on October 23, and again on November 1, for a programme of stormwater clearing. I am constantly getting complaints about flooding in the area. The rainy season is upon us and every stormwater drain in the area is blocked,&#x201D; she said.She added that the N3 highway &#x2013; where the flooding happened on Wednesday &#x2013; flooded during a flash storm in January.The city, however, denied this.Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said the city conducts regular maintenance of its stormwater drainage systems.&#x201C;It is, however, inevitable that the drain systems will be blocked when there is heavy rain as experienced on Wednesday. This is because rain water sweeps grime and foreign objects into the sewer line causing it to clog,&#x201D; he said.Maintenance and unblocking of storm water drains started on Wednesday in Bedfordview, Tembisa, and Edenvale as these were the severely affected areas, he said.The City of Joburg on Thursday dispatched several teams to mop up after the flash flood.Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba offered condolences to affected residents and motorists and said the city was doing all it could to assist with the mop up.

Disaster management is facilitating temporary accommodation and relief supplies to victims.&#x201D; The city&#x2019;s department of health and social development, in conjunction with NGOs and the provincial government, are on the ground handing out blankets and food parcels to those who have lost their belongings. The department of community development is opening community halls for those who have lost belongings to provide safe and dry shelter. The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) is out assessing the damage to infrastructure, clearing debris, silt and other obstructions to our roads, bridges and storm water drainage systems.&#x201C;Our city has experienced a flash flood beyond the capacity of our stormwater systems. Unfortunately, any severe storm or flash flooding that occurs will result in isolated flooding as the road infrastructure is not designed for these severities. However, I wish to assure the public that JRA is working tirelessly to resolve blockages and repair faulty traffic lights resulting from the flash flood. JMPD officers have also been deployed to assist with traffic control to affected intersections,&#x201D; Mashaba said.On Thursday he visited the Sandton Fire Station, which is being used as a briefing venue for departments and entities to coordinate and plan interventions and assistance.Thereafter he went to Alexandra, which has been one of the worst affected areas following the flash flood.It has been reported that close to 200 families lost their homes in Alexandra&apos;s Setswetla section alone.
