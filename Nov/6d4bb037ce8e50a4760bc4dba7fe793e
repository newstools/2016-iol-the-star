Johannesburg - A group of fraudsters posing as City Power officials intent on robbing residents is doing the rounds in Joburg&#x2019;s suburbs.The utility said the modus operandi used by three males was to claim that the household was in arrears with its electricity bill even though the customer might be on a prepaid meter. The fraudsters reportedly then threaten to cut off the power supply to those who refuse to pay the phantom electricity bills on the spot.City Power is appealing to all its customers not to make any cash payments to contractors or officials requesting money for outstanding electricity bills.They should make payments at the City of Joburg customer walk-in centres or at the utility&#x2019;s offices.During the launch of Operation Clean-Up earlier in the year, City Power&#x2019;s board chairman, Frank Chikane, urged customers to report criminal incidents or corrupt behaviour on the part of officials and contractors of City Power.He warned customers who colluded with officials and service providers on unauthorised transactions that they would be found liable for criminal prosecution.Because of the anti-corruption drive, City Power has been able to blow the lid on corrupt officials wanting to defraud unsuspecting customers.The utility has partnered with authorities on an anti-corruption drive to eliminate incidents like these.To date, 851 cases have been registered with the SAPS and the prosecuting authorities relating to cable theft, malicious damage to property and meters including domestic and large power users.As many as 782 arrests and 274 convictions have taken place.&#x201C;Customers are urged to properly check contractor cards to verify the identity of the person before allowing them on to their property.&#x201D;All City Power contractors are expected to carry their identification cards with them at all times and each card has an expiry date.Customers should be aware that contract officials are not permitted to request cash payments for unpaid bills.&#x201C;If a customer receives a request of this nature they should recognise it as fraudulent behaviour and report the case immediately,&#x201D; said Sicelo Xulu, City Power managing director.The anti-corruption drive will not only hone in on billing fraud, but will continue to focus attention on high-risk areas around metering, namely applications for new meters, relocation and reconnection of existing meters as well as the procurement processes within City Power&#x2019;s supply chain unit.Customers can anonymously report incidents of fraud and corruption or any suspicious officials to the hotline 0800 002 587 or [email&#160;protected] [email&#160;protected] @annacox The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
