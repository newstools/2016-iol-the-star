Johannesburg - The search for the Alexandra toddler who was swept away by the Jukskei River during last week&#x2019;s floods continued until late on Sunday evening.Joburg Emergency Management Services spokesperson Nana Radebe said search and rescue teams &#x201C;started from the beginning&#x201D; on Sunday after making their way to Hartbeespoort Dam in North West in search of three-year-old Everite Chauke.&#x201C;Unfortunately we&#x2019;ve found nothing up until now. We&#x2019;ve started afresh in Alexandra this morning (on Sunday). We&#x2019;re checking everything from the riverbanks to searching through debris, to make sure we haven&#x2019;t missed anything,&#x201D; said Radebe.The child was washed away after her home, located next to the Jukskei River, was flooded.The child&#x2019;s father had climbed up a tree with him but the branch they were sitting on broke and he lost his grip on little Everite.Meanwhile, Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed on Sunday the body of woman who had drowned was found on Saturday morning. She was six months pregnant.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s believed she was swept away during the floods near Alexandra while in her vehicle. Her vehicle was found on Friday, but it was empty,&#x201D; Makhubele said.&#x201C;Her body was found on the N3 along the Jukskei River. Police divers as well as a rescue team managed to recover the body.&#x201D;This brings the death toll from severe storms and flooding across the province to eight. On Thursday, a man in his 30s was struck by lightning in Vanderbijlpark. Six others died during Wednesday&#x2019;s flash floods.Premier David Makhura has said he plans to declare parts of Gauteng disaster areas.The heavy rains over the past few days have brought some relief to the ailing Vaal Dam.The dam level, which was at 26 percent a week ago, has reportedly now reached 29 percent.And water released from Sterkfontein Dam in the past week to keep the Vaal above 25 percent is expected to reach the dam in the next few days.
