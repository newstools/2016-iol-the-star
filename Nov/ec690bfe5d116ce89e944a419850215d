Pretoria News - Suspended national police commissioner General Riah Phiyega s fate will soon be decided, as a report by the Claassen Board of Inquiry into her fitness to hold office has been concluded. The board has now completed its report regarding the fitness or lack thereof of the national police commissioner to hold office, commission chairperson Judge Neels Claassen said. The report will be handed over to the president on a date determined by the president. The report will be distributed as provided for in the legislation, the judge added.The country s top cop was suspended by President Jacob Zuma following allegations of misconduct emanating from the Farlam Commission of Inquiry report.The commission investigated the deaths of 44 people killed during labour unrest at Lonmin s platinum mine in Marikana in August 2012.The president subsequently appointed Judge Claassen to head the inquiry, assisted by advocates Bernard Khuzwayo and Anusha Rawjee.The terms of reference included investigating whether Phiyega, acting with others in the SAPS leadership structures, misled the Farlam Commission by hiding the fact that they had authorised the tactical option during a management meeting a day before the killings. The hearings were concluded on June 3, and on the last day, Phiyega s counsel appealed for the acquittal of the beleaguered top cop. You can say no action should be taken against her, or you can recommend reduction of her salary or that she be transferred to another department... So you have a whole lot of options, said William Mokhari SC. But we are saying that, based on the evidence, you should acquit her of all the charges. Pretoria News
