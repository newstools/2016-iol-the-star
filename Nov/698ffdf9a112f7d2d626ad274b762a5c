Johannesburg - In an alleged act of mob justice, an Ekurhuleni community attempted to set a teenager, who they believed was involved in criminal activity, alight.The youngster managed to survive the arson attack in Etwatwa on Thursday but he sustained serious injuries during the altercation.Provincial police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said those responsible for the attack have since been taken into custody.&#x201C;Fourteen of the mob (all males) were arrested and will be charged with assault with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm and attempted murder,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;The victim was taken to the nearest hospital for medical treatment.&#x201D;Masondo explained that the 16-year-old was ambushed by the community as he was accused of being part of the notorious Overloaded gang - popularly known as OVL.The men then accosted the teenager, assaulted him and attempted to set him alight.&#x201C;Police responded swiftly after receiving a call about the attack and managed to rescue the boy from the mob,&#x201D; said Masondo.This was not the first time that the Etwatwa community, near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, took the law into their own hands in regards to those they believed were responsible for being involved in the gang which allegedly terrorised the community.In September last year, The Star reported about several teenagers who were attacked by the same community over their involvement in the feared gang.One of them was a youngster who narrowly escaped death after he was necklaced with a tractor tyre when irate residents went on the rampage, hunting down members.Police, including some from the Tactical Response Team (TRT), kept a heavy presence in the area at the time while some residents said they haven&#x2019;t been going to work because they feared the gang would attack them.Pupils also said they feared walking in the streets after school because OVL members often tried to force them to join the gang.
