Parliament - The EFF is due to table a draft resolution in Parliament on Tuesday to have apartheid laws dropped.The state has laid charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 against the party's leader Julius Malema after he urged people to invade unoccupied land.The EFF leader and his party have challenged the old law, saying no charges could be brought under an apartheid law.Malema has appeared in the Bloemfontein and Newcastle magistrate s courts, where the matters were postponed to December 7 and May next year respectively.Malema said South Africans needed land to improve their lives.He accused the ANC-led government of dragging its feet in addressing the land issue.Land has been at the centre of discussions in the portfolio committee on rural development and land reform. The committee is holding public hearings on the Extension of Security of Tenure Bill, which seeks to address the question of the rights of occupiers and regulate the eviction of farmworkers.The hearings have been held in Limpopo, and the committee was in the Northern Cape last week.The committee will next year also deal with another land issue that came from the Constitutional Court judgment.The court stopped the implementation of the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Bill in July this year after it found defects in the legislative process. It called for more public hearings and ordered that no land claims be lodged for 18 months while the defects in the bill were being addressed.Political Bureau
