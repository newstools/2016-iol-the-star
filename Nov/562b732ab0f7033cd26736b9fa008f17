Johannesburg - Parts of Joburg are struggling to keep the water flowing as reservoirs run low due to the heat, high evaporation and low rainfall.Reservoirs in Lenasia, Northcliff, Alexander Park and Randjesfontein are running low and it&#x2019;s leading to low water or no water pressure in the areas the reservoirs supply.&#x201C;Residents need to realise that the fact that water has been released from Sterkfontein Dam into the Vaal (Dam) doesn&#x2019;t mean there&#x2019;s enough water. We are dipping into reserves,&#x201D; said Johannesburg Water spokesperson Hilgard Matthews.He said the reservoirs had struggled to recover in light of recent heatwaves and drought that have hit the province.&#x201C;Since the end of the heatwave, these reservoirs have been struggling to pick up pressure, which has resulted in areas having no water for days.&#x201D;Matthews said the utility would further restrict outflows from several reservoirs in a bid to give them a chance to recover.&#x201C;Outlets of these reservoirs will be limited between 8pm to 5am every day for the rest of the week until Sunday, to recover them. This means that we will continue minimal outflow into the streets to keep the system from running dry, but there will be low pressure to no water.&#x201D;Matthews said consumption was so high that water levels and pressure couldn&#x2019;t recover.&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t planned rationing, it&#x2019;s a way of saving our reservoirs and the entire network because the system is sensitive. If it runs dry, we will have more bursts and lose even more water,&#x201D; he said.He urged residents to continue using water-saving methods, reminding them that Joburg remained on Level 2 restrictions.&#x201C;We need the public to work with us so that we can reach that 15 percent of water saved.&#x201D;Matthews warned that if the savings target wasn&#x2019;t met, the utility would be forced to introduce water rationing and Level 3 restrictions.He reminded residents that there would be normal pipe bursts across the city and not all loss of water pressure was related to restrictions.Areas affected by low water levels at Lenasia and Northcliff reservoirs include Lenasia, Vlakfontein, Lehae, Finetown, Northcliff, Fairland, Blackheath and Berario.Low water levels at Alexander Park reservoir are affecting Kensington and extensions, Jeppestown South, Malvern, Bruma and Bezuidenhout Valley.Many residents took to Twitter to voice their thoughts.@NomalangaSA chastised residents for overusing water. &#x201C;Joburg ya&#x2019;ll have no water but acting YOLO with hosepipes and showers.&#x201D;@RodriguesTima said her family in Lenasia hadn&#x2019;t had water for more than 24 hours. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the update? This is ridiculous.&#x201D;@meeshamanga said it was the second day Lenasia extensions 9 and 10 had no water. &#x201C;No water tankers have been sent out. What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201D;@zinzimhlomeli asked: &#x201C;Can we have water in Northcliff already? Geez what the hell is this?&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] @Lanc_02 The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
