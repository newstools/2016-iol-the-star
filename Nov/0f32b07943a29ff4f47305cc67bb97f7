Johannesburg - Murder accused Patrick Wisani has closed his case after his final three witnesses failed to arrive in court.The trial had been postponed for a week-and-a-half to allow Wisani, who is being kept in custody and is representing himself, time to organise the last of his witnesses and start preparing his closing arguments.Wisani is accused of beating his girlfriend Nosipho Mandleleni to death with a broomstick and a sjambok. He was chairperson of the ANC Youth League in the Joburg inner city at the time.On Monday, Wisani appeared impatient and irritated when he was brought up from the holding cells in the high court sitting in Randburg after realising his witnesses hadn&#x2019;t arrived. He failed to get hold of them after being lent a phone to call them.Although Judge Mohamed Ismail said he would allow a further postponement to give the accused another chance to contact his witnesses, Wisani opted to close his case instead.He then asked the court if he could submit the statements of two of the State&#x2019;s witnesses, because he had forgotten to do so when the witnesses testified.Judge Ismail explained to him that that was not how the process worked.&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t come and recall witnesses simply because the weather was too hot on a certain day and today it is a bit cooler... The fact that you decided to do your own case... the court can&#x2019;t treat (you) differently from any other person. I have to be fair to everybody equally.&#x201D;Prosecutor Faghre Mohamed argued that the witnesses and, by default, the State&#x2019;s case, could be prejudiced if they had to be called again.&#x201C;(Wisani is) not exempt from the normal rules regarding evidence,&#x201D; Mohamed said.After quoting a number of precedent-setting cases, Judge Ismail allowed Wisani to submit the witness statements as evidence.&#x201C;The right to a fair case is enshrined in the constitution. I am going to permit the statements to be handed in, but I&#x2019;m not going to allow Mr Wisani to cross-examine the witnesses.&#x201C;The only reason that the court is permitting these statements is that the court is of the view that there was an innocent or mistaken omission on the part of Mr Wisani...&#x201D;He postponed the case to Friday, when closing arguments will be heard.
