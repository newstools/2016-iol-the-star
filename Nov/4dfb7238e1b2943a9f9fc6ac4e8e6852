Johannesburg - Another of Radovan Krejcir&#x2019;s mistresses has been arrested, after allegedly assisting in a plot to break the Czech fugitive out of prison.Vanessa Naidoo was nabbed on Friday and appeared on Monday in the Kempton Park Magistrate&#x2019;s Court, where she has been charged with the same crimes as her former lover, two prison security officials, a suspected gangster and Marissa Christopher, another of the Czech&#x2019;s mistresses.Christopher was arrested in July while she and Krejcir&#x2019;s two-year-old daughter visited him at Zonderwater Prison in Tshwane.The State has argued that Christopher was going to facilitate payments to prison officials and a group of rifle-wielding gunmen to storm the prison and allow Krejcir to escape. The plot was planned for March but an undercover police unit, where officers posed as the guns-for-hire, foiled the escape plan.During Christopher&#x2019;s bail application in August, she spoke of how the lead investigator had informed her that her brother&#x2019;s ex-girlfriend, Naidoo, had also been having a sexual relationship with Krejcir and may have been assisting in smuggling contraband into the prison.After this revelation, her relationship with the Czech deteriorated and they broke up around April.But now the women will be forced to spend time together as they appear on charges of defeating the administration of justice, conspiring to allow a prisoner to escape from custody and corruption.Naidoo is expected to appear again at the court with her co-accused on November 9.
