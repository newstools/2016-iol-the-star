[WARNING: The video shown below contains graphic violence]Johannesburg - Another video showing an apparent racial attack has emerged following the #CoffinAssault recording, which showed two white men assaulting Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa in Middelburg, Mpumalanga.The latest video, which was shared by @BongzThaMr_K on Twitter on Friday, shows an Afrikaans-speaking male repeatedly assaulting two young black men.It is not clear where and when the video was taken.The Afrikaans-speaking male warns one young male that he is going to be on camera in what appears to be punishment for allegedly telling someone that the two young men were planning to steal something. You are on camera now, neh. That guy (pointing to the second assaulted male) says it's you who told him where to go and steal and what, what, what, and that you are the one who cut his hair, he ranted.Shortly after that, he began to slap, kick and shove both males, who continuously pleaded their innocence to the allegations. It s not me, one said. Serious baas, it s not me, ask Michael, baas (the absent person in the footage whom the two referred to in order to prove their innocence). Call Michael, it s not me, serious, baas, said the other.In response, the man continued to slap them to the ground, yelling serious se p**s it s you man! F**k you, Michael s brother told me that it s you. Among those who commented on the video was @diewolfie, who implied that nothing was being done about white victims of physical assault, responding [email&#160;protected]_K's caption which said: Can we all help find this Afrikaans guy, like you did the #CoffinCourtCase duo? @diewolfie tweeted: Please also help us find the people who did this (referring to a collage of badly bruised white people). Others expressed empathy for those assaulted. @BongzTha-Mr_K tweeted This hurt me , while @stsindane tweeted: This ended my day when I saw it.
