Johannesburg - Scores of people in Ennerdale, south of Joburg, were salvaging their belongings on Tuesday after their homes and vehicles were damaged by a tornado which struck the area on Monday night.As residents tried to salvage whatever possessions they could, some were grateful to escape the extreme weather phenomenon unscathed.Among them was Magdalene Mazibuko and her two young children, whose lives were spared when the roof of their house collapsed while they were sitting in the lounge.Mazibuko said bricks were ripped out of the walls inside the house and struck them. &#x201C;I was drinking tea with my children when I heard a loud bang, and then my roof fell to the floor,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;I still can&#x2019;t believe we survived it, I know it was God who saved us,&#x201D; Mazibuko said.Although the family didn&#x2019;t sustain any injuries, her 13-year-old son complained of pain in one of his legs.Despite living to tell the tale, Mazibuko is now left to piece her life together after the tornado, accompanied by heavy rain and strong winds, damaged most of the contents of her home, including the furniture, beds, appliances and clothing.&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how to put everything back together,&#x201D; she said as she fought back tears.Her neighbour Lydia Shabalala&#x2019;s house was also destroyed when the tornado struck. The 65-year-old and her teenage grandson were also at home when their roof collapsed.Shabalala said it started raining on and off in the afternoon. When the storm broke, she heard the wind blow violently.When she looked out her window, she saw her neighbour&#x2019;s roof being flung through the air. &#x201C;I ran outside and saw a big black cloud with a tail at the bottom,&#x201D; she said.Soon afterwards, the roof of her house was also ripped off, with parts of thewalls of the house collapsing and rain pouring in. &#x201C;My grandson and I had to sleep at my son&#x2019;s house in Lenasia,&#x201D;Shabalala said.Despite the trail of destruction that the tornado left behind, a sense of camaraderie prevailed as residents banded together to mop up Extension 8, where the damage was extensive.Together, they were seen digging through debris, including broken cement and bricks from the damaged houses and perimeter walls, as well as pieces of corrugated iron from the roofs that had been blown off.Johannesburg Emergency Management Services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said dozens of houses in the area were damaged. &#x201C;A total of 53 houses have been assessed and most of them had damaged roofs and collapsed walls,&#x201D; he said.One person was injured in the extreme weather conditions and taken to hospital, Mulaudzi said.
