Johannesburg - The ANC Greater Joburg region is gunning for DA mayor Herman Mashaba, accusing him of grandstanding in cancelling millions of rands worth of government programmes which include the controversial bicycle lanes.Mashaba also came under fire for issuing title deeds to Joburg homeowners that were withheld by the former ANC administration; his comments on the SA Local Government Association, and on the fight against corruption.ANC Greater Joburg regional treasurer Geoffrey Makhubo described Mashaba as a man with no clue about how budgets were allocated or reallocated in a municipality.Makhubo was addressing a media briefing in Joburg on Wednesday with his regional comrades including Connie Bapela, Dada Morero, and Jolidee Matongo.Makhubo criticised Mashaba's position on the bicycle lanes, saying the cycling community and the residents of Joburg deserve a mayor who understands the need for an integrated transport system in a metropolitan city like ours .Mashaba, a self-made multimillionaire, was also rapped on the knuckles for issues title deeds to Joburg residents. Mr Mashaba did not tell the people ... that these title deeds ... were a product of a protracted process that the ANC government engaged in to ensure that they were delivered. On corruption, Makhubo said the fight against the social ill and crime, had been the number one priority of the ANC government since the dawn of democracy. The Joburg metro had been working with law enforcement agencies including the SA Police Service, Hawks, and the National Prosecuting Authority on allegations of fraud and corruption, among others.A total of 270 investigations, said Makhubo, were concluded between 2012/2013 and had resulted in 251 public servants being dismissed; and 11 officials resigned during/after the investigations; and 97 criminal cases were opened.DA Joburg regional chairperson Khume Ramulifho said: Today's press conference should be seen for what it is - petty, political opportunism and grandstanding.
