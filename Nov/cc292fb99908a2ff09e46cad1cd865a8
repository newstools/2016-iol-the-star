Johannesburg - Radovan Krejcir&#x2019;s security has been escalated to the highest possible level after the police Special Task Force - South Africa&#x2019;s counter-terrorism unit - was assigned to monitor his court proceedings.The Star can reveal that this comes as investigators were informed of yet another escape plot, where mercenary, ex-military forces were allegedly set to be hired to break the Czech fugitive out of prison.Sources linked to the Krejcir investigation have said that since intelligence about the plot was received, the security surrounding the Czech was increased and he was transferred to yet another prison.On Monday, Krejcir appeared in the high court in Joburg, alongside his four co-accused, for the murder of alleged Bedfordview drug kingpin Sam Issa.The security task force monitoring Krejcir&#x2019;s numerous court cases was first escalated earlier this year after another escape plot in which Krejcir was allegedly hiring armed thugs to storm Zonderwater Prison.But on Monday, the usual armed police were accompanied by sniper rifle-wielding officers, later revealed to be part of the Special Task Force.The Star&#x2019;s sources said Krejcir has been moved to Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Pretoria, which - while classified as a medium-security prison - has a section reserved for high-risk prisoners. &#x201C;Until the threat has subsided, he will be staying there,&#x201D; a source said.According to the Special Task Force website, the team is responsible for controlling hostage situations on land, sea or air; deals with urban and rural terrorism; can offer counter-sniper measures; and provides rescue services during natural disasters.On Monday at court, Krejcir&#x2019;s lawyer, Frank Cohen, told the presiding judge his client has been unable to speak to his &#x201C;sponsors&#x201D; in the Czech Republic because of the prison transfer. Unable to use the prison phones, Krejcir claimed he could not organise funds for his legal team, with Cohen asking the court for a postponement so that the issue could be resolved. Another of Krejcir&apos;s lovers held over prison break planBut prosecutor Lawrence Gcaba said Krejcir had used his finances as an excuse to prevent the trial from going ahead for months, and there was no guarantee he could or would resolve the issue.&#x201C;This court cannot be held hostage by one accused,&#x201D; he told the court.The Issa murder trial was meant to start in April but has been scuppered by dozens of issues - many of which have emanated from the numerous defence attorneys involved.Judge Winston Mihloti Msimeki seemed to agree with Gcaba, and appeared irritated by Cohen&#x2019;s request for yet another postponement.He said that at the next appearance on Wednesday, he would rule on whether the trial would start during this court term.However, it&#x2019;s understood that another issue is set to arise. Annelene van den Heever, the lawyer representing Krejcir&#x2019;s co-accused Siboniso Miya, has said she is unavailable for the rest of the court term, meaning she will probably request that the trial begin next year.According to her colleague Sinen Mnguni, Van den Heever didn&#x2019;t appear in court on Monday after accidentally injuring herself and &#x201C;rendering herself immobile&#x201D;.
